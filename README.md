<b>Classification of products based on image using ML.</b>

<b>I have added the python code for classification of two Product using TensorFlow and Keras Libraries.</b>

<b>Import the necessary libraries which have been imported in python code.</b>

<b>Read the Process Explanation.docx which contains the detailed process of this project along with images.</b>

```
import threading, webbrowser   #add this line in import section

threading.Timer(1.25, lambda: webbrowser.open("http://localhost:5000/") ).start()  
#add above line before app.run(host="localhost",port=5000,debug=False) 
```

<b>The above two lines of code will help you in opening the webpage automatically on default web browser while you start the flask server(Add code in the app.py for that automatically opening of webpage).If needed you can use them.</b>

<b>Since model file size is too large(47 MB),I couldn't add the model file here,kindly follow the instructions in Process Explanation.docx file and create it and use it.</b>


<b>Sometimes TensorFlow may shows error while running because Tensorflow needs some Hardware/Software in your System for processing.Please search in internet for solutions of errors.</b>
