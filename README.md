<b>Classification of products based on image using ML.</b>

<b>I have added the python code for classification of two Product using TensorFlow and Keras Libraries.</b>

<b>Import the necessary libraries which have been imported in python code.</b>

<b>Read the Process Explanation.docx which contains the detailed process of this project along with images.</b>

<b>Since model file size is too large(47 MB),I couldn't add the model file here,kindly follow the instructions in Process Explanation.docx file and create it and use it.</b>


<b>Sometimes TensorFlow may shows error while running because Tensorflow needs some Hardware/Software in your System for processing.Please search in internet for solutions of errors.</b>
