<b>Classification of products based on image using ML.</b>

<b>I have added the python code for classification of two Product using TensorFlow and Keras Libraries.</b>

<b>Import the necessary libraries which have been imported in python code.</b>

<b>Read the Process Explanation.doc which contains the detailed process of this project along with images.</b>

<b>Since model file size is too large(47 MB),I couldn't add the model file here,kindly follow the instructions in Process Explanation.doc.</b>


<b>Since Tensorflow needs some hardware in your System for processing, it might show error while running. Please search in internet for solutions of errors.</b>
